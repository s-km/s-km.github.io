      content="Hi, I'm Srdjan; a software developer from Canada. In my off time, I like to play video games, boulder, and read. As a developer, my main interests are scaling software and the challenges of writing performant, readable, and maintainable code in a rapidly changing environment. I'll try to sometimes write about cool stuff, but in general this is a place where you can find my various online profiles, some projects I've worked on, and get in touch with me."

          Feel free to send an email to <code class="email">s(at)sm(dot)dev</code>. I'm pretty bad
          at remembering to respond to messages, but if you send one I promise I'll get back to you.
        </p>

          You can get my resume <a href="../assets/srdjan_cv.pdf">here</a>. In general, I'm open to
          anything as long as the team is great and the work is interesting. I'm currently in
          Toronto, but wouldn't mind relocating pretty much anywhere in Canada, the US, Europe, and
          New Zealand.
