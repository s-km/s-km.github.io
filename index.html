          Hey, I'm Srdjan. I'm a software developer from Canada.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my off time, I like to play video games, boulder, and read. As a developer, my main
          interests are scaling software and the challenges of writing performant, readable, and
          maintainable code in a rapidly changing environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'll try to sometimes write things down here, but in general this is just a place where
          you can find my various online profiles and get in touch with me.
        </p>
